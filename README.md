    *   Office hours: F 9:30-11:00 on Zoom (link on Canvas)

### Course Purpose
To teach about, encourage, and give students time for research. Also to establish vertical cohorts among students interested in the same subfield.

### Course Organization
There are six constituencies who will not be treated exactly equally in the course because their needs are different:
*   **first-year students**: need general context and help on first research projects and first-year papers;
*   **second-year students**: need feedback on the research they have done, prepare for further research, and write second-year papers;
*   **third-year students**: need to write their Qualifying Papers (QP), write grant proposals;
*   **post-candidacy pre-proposal students**: need to write and present their dissertation proposals;
*   **post-candidacy dissertation students**: need to write dissertations, get feedback;
*   **students from other departments**: needs will vary. NOTE that this course is designed to provide support and necessary foundations to research in Computational Linguistics, rather than an overview of research topics. You are expected to carry out one research project throughout the semester.

### Course Components
*   [Suggested topic list](#Topics)
*   Research seminar: This semester we focus on a recent papers in computational linguistics. Topics and readings will be given under [schedule](#Schedule). 
This semester we will try a **new format**: each will prepare 3 bullets about what you like about the paper, 3 bullets about what you don't, plus questions/other comments!
*   Discussion of ongoing student research:
    *   Round-table: short presentations by all participants about their current research. This will happen almost every week.
    *   On-going research: longer presentations (30 minutes or an hour including discussion), students, faculty, auditors if they wish.
    *   Dissertation proposal presentations.
    *   Dissertation progress talks.
    *   Practice talks for conference presentations.

*   **Students from other departments**: a course project, with 2 documents: intermediate report (2-3 pages), final report (8 pages).

### COVID Guidance
To help keep everyone at UT and in our community safe, it is critical that students report COVID-19 symptoms and testing, regardless of test results, to [University Health Services](https://www.healthyhorns.utexas.edu/), and faculty and staff report to the [HealthPoint Occupational Health Program (OHP)](https://hr.utexas.edu/current/services/occupational-health-program) as soon as possible. Please see [this link](https://hr.utexas.edu/current/services/occupational-health-program) to understand what needs to be reported.  In addition, to help understand what to do if a fellow student in the class (or the instructor or TA) tests positive for COVID, see [this University Health Services link](https://healthyhorns.utexas.edu/coronavirus_exposure_action_chart.html).
